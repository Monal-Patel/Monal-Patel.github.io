<p>Hello, I am a young researcher. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering and Computional Fluid Dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>I am curious about many natural and human phenomena, as well as novel engineering endeavours. I have developed numerical methods for modelling atmospheric re-entry (hypersonic) flows, and investigated aspects of hypersonic flows in my <strong>PhD</strong>. The key sub-projects from my PhD were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adpative Mesh Refinement with Immersed Boundary Method for hypersonic flows (2018 - Ongoing). <strong>Journal pre-print</strong></li>
<li>Heat transfer in destructive atmospheric entry entries (2018 - Ongoing). <strong>Journal pre-print</strong></li>
<li>Hypersonic ablation fluid-structure interaction (2018 - Ongoing). <strong>Conference paper</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, I enjoy research which helps explain and preferebly quantify, previously unexplained or qualitative, physical phenomena. I also enjoy many aspects in computational science, in particular, developing more efficient and novel numerical methods.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-website">About this website</h2>
<p>The aims for this website is to collate and present my thoughts and works. In addition to my digital notes in OneNote, this website allows and maybe even forces me, to distill my notes into a more accessible manner.</p>
<p>The target audience is an intelligent and interested reader, to begin with, I consider my future-self as the primary reader.</p>
<p>The website remains under active design and development. The current design philosophy is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aesthetically-pleasing minimalism.</li>
<li>Take advantage of web platforms. This is not a book on the internet.</li>
</ul>
